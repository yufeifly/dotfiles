# configurations
It is my configurations of vim.

1. To use .vimrc, you should first install vundle.
Vundle is a software to help you manage the plugins.

	git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

2. After enter into the VIM page by the command:
	vim
you should run 
	PluginInstall
to install the plugins managed by vundle.
